# LoanProphet: Predictive Loan Analysis

This project is a data science analysis focused on predicting loan approval status using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on various features and attributes.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Selection:** Exploring and implementing machine learning algorithms suitable for binary classification tasks.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Utilizing appropriate evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the predictive models.
- **Visualization:** Generating insightful visualizations to interpret the data and model predictions effectively.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Execute the Python script `loan_prediction_analysis.py` to run the analysis.
4. Follow the prompts to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
